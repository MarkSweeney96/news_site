# News Site

This is a news site I designed and developed in my first year of college. It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and a MySQL database. All the news stories are live text directly from the MySQL database and the images are all hardcoded. This project was graded across three different modules: Databases, Web Design and Development as well as my Integrated Project module which ties the two together.  


## Installation
To install this project on your computer, you will need to:
1. Install a local Apache Web Server and a MySQL database server. [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) is a good piece of software that installs both.   
2. Create a new database called 'news' and import the __news.sql__ file located in this repository.
3. __NB__: Make sure the __classes/DB.php__ file has the correct information for your local web server and database.
