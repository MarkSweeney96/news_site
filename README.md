# News Site
This repository contains a news stories site I designed and developed in my first year of college.
It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and an SQL database. All the news stories are live text directly from the SQL database. The images are all hardcoded.

To install this project you will need to:
1. Install a local Apache Web Server and a MySQL database server. <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html">XAMPP</a> is a good piece of software that install both.   
2. Create a new database called 'news' and import the <i>news.sql</i> file located in this repository.
3. <b>NB:</b> Make sure the classes/DB.php file has the correct information for your local web server and database.

I got an A grade for this project. It was graded across three different modules: Databases, Web Design and Development as well as my Integrated Project module which ties the two together.

You can browse through all of my code above and see some screenshots of the project in action below:
